The Lost Symbol is a truly exceptional book. Filled with mysteries and thrills, it will definitely give you an immersive experience. Once you start, you cant stop. Until the book is finished. After which you start questioning your life choices. Yes, I speak from personal experience. This thriller novel sold over 30 million copies (as of 2013), and was on the #1 spot on the New York Times Best Seller list for about 30 weeks.

A bit about the author himself, **Dan Gerhard Brown** (born Jun 22, 1964), writes books (duh), mainly about treasure hunts that threaten the existence of mankind if not finished within a day. He is an author who truly deserves getting the Nobel Prize for literature (apart from me, of course). Some of his well known works are "Angels & Demons", "The Da Vinci Code", "The Lost Symbol", "Inferno" and "Origin". Three novels out of these have also been adapted into films. His novels usually theme cryptography, art and conspiracy theories. Which often lead to him being involved in multiple religious debates, as multiple people think his books are an attack at Christianity.

### The book. (WARNING: Spoilers ahead =D)

Renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is suddenly invited, by his mentor and friend Peter Solomon - the head of the Smithsonian Institution and a rich 33<sup>rd</sup> degree [Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry) -, to give a lecture at the United States Capitol. He is requested to bring along with him a small sealed package that was entrusted to him by Peter years ago. When he arrives though, he comes to the realization that there is no lecture, and that the invitation was fake. He also comes to the knowledge that Peter was kidnapped, and the invitation was in fact from his kidnapper, Mal'akh, who posed as Peter's assistant on the phone. He enters the building and leaves Peter's severed hand in a cryptic position pointing upwards in the center of the Capitol Rotunda. Mal'akh then makes contact, instructing Langdon to find the Mason's Pyramid, a myth he believes is real and is hidden somewhere in London. If he isn't able to find the Pyramid, then Peter would simply die.

At the Capitol, Robert meets Inoue Sato, the head of CIA's Office of Security. She claims that capturing Mal'akh was of much more importance than saving Peter's life, as he apparently poses a "national threat". When Robert enquires why, Sato does not elaborate. Robert follows the clue (the severed hand), which leads him to the basements of the Capitol, where there are multiple lockers in the size of rooms, where they go to SBB13 (sub sub basement 13) where they find a small truncated pyramid, with an inscription. Meanwhile, Sato sees an X-ray scan of Langdon's bag when entering the Capitol and sees a very dense, small package, that Langdon was apparently trying to hide by clutching his bag tightly. When she questions Robert about it, he says that he doesn't know the contents (which is true, as Peter instructed Robert to never open the package), but she thinks that he's lying and takes him into custody. Before she can arrest him though, the Architect of the Capitol (who is also a mason, and close friend of Peter's) barges in and knocks Sato and Police Chief Anderson out and rescues Robert. He explains that Mal'akh had contacted him too, and he was in a hurry to save Peter's life.

We are then to introduced to Mal'akh, who in my opinion is a total weirdo gone crazy in the name of religion (or whatever Masonry is), who has covered his entire body with tattoos, except a spot on his bald head that he was saving for engraving something special. He had apparently infiltrated the Mason's circle, and reached the highest ring (the 33<sup>rd</sup>) by donating an extremely large amount of money to charity. Hold up - let me first explain how this Freemasonry thing works. So, in simple terms, freemasonry is a brotherhood, consisting of multiple "rings" within "rings", the uppermost and innermost being the "33<sup>rd</sup> degree". This ring apparently holds the most dangerous and powerful secrets the brotherhood has to offer, and Mal'akh was extremely desperate to get that power, which he believed would make him a god.

We then see a backstory of Peter. Peter had a son, Zachary, who was extremely spoilt. Peter had presented to Zachary a choice: infinite wisdom, or <span class="tooltip" data-tip="not really infinite, just a really large amount of money that every person in the Solomon family gets">infinite</span> money. Zachary chooses the money and flees as he thought that the "wisdom" option was just a scam so that Peter could save his money. He later gets arrested because he was caught for smuggling large amounts of drugs. Peter flies to Turkey, where Zach was imprisoned, but decides to leave him in there for a week in order to teach him a lesson. Zach overhears all this and silently rages. We then see Zachary get murdered by his cellmate who had made a deal with the jail warden for his money. The cellmate flew to the island of Syros in Greece where he lived a luxurious life on steroids, of which he eventually gets bored. He recalls his conversation with Zachary about the Solomon life, after which he decides, and breaks into home of Peter, in an attempt to find the Pyramid, but accidentally kills Isabel Solomon (Peter's mom) instead. He is then pursued, shot, and left to die in a freezing river by a raging Peter. However, he survives and nurses himself back to health, covering his scars with tattoos. He then decides to infiltrate the Freemasons under the name of Mal'akh.

We then come back to the present, where we see Katherine Solomon (Peter's sister) lab being blown up by Mal'akh. She had been conducting experiments in [Noetic Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetics) in the process of trying to force Peter to give him the location of the Pyramid, but she manages to meet up with her old friend, Langdon, and Bellamy. Eventually, they are found by the CIA, and Bellamy is forced to give himself up to let Katherine and Langdon escape. Bellamy states that he believes Sato is working *for* Mal'akh, but Sato assures him that it's quite the opposite case, and is able to convince him so after showing him a video leaving him visibly frightened and stunned. Langdon and Katherine have a respectful debate about whether or not they should decipher the pyramid's code, as everyone they had met along the way had strictly advised them not to, as it could wreak havoc. Katherine still felt her brother's life was more important though, but before they could decipher the code, they are caught by the CIA. They agree to give a fake location to Mal'akh in an attempt to ambush him, and go there, lying in wait.

Following clues that pointed to say that Peter's apparent psychiatrist, "Dr. Christopher Abbadon", was actually Mal'akh, Katherine had previously phoned the local police to go to Mal'akh's house and investigate. She then received a call saying that they found her brother, in a very poor state. Robert and Katherine manage to convince Sato to go to the house to meet Peter. Unfortunately for them, Mal'akh is right there, awaiting in ambush, and manages to kill their CIA escort. He then traps Langdon in a sensory-deprivation tank, which slowly filled up with water, as Mal'akh pressured him to decipher the code. Langdon deciphers the code, drowns, and then dies. Mal'akh then binds Katherine on a chair/slab thing and inserts an open needle into her arm, through which blood slowly started to pour out. He then brings in Peter, who was in a wheelchair, to witness the scene. He starts threatening Peter to help him find the secret, otherwise he would leave Katherine in there to die. They then go to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple (TRotSRHotT), where he pressures Peter into telling him the "Lost Word".

Meanwhile, Sato and her team reach Mal'akh's mansion where they find Katherine and are able to save her. They are also able to save Langdon, as the "water" in the tank was actually breathable oxygenated liquid, and that the tank was used for deep states of meditation. Sato and Langdon then race to TRotSRHotT in a helicopter in which Sato showed Langdon the same video that Mal'akh was threatening to release online. It showed multiple highly ranked U.S officers and other Masons performing a secret sacred ritual that looked very disturbing out of context (obviously edited). Meanwhile, Mal'akh is able to get the word out of Peter, which is "circumpunct", ie a symbol in the shape of a dot in the center of a circle, representing the sun god Ra in ancient Egypt.

Mal'akh proceeds to tattoo the symbol on the remaining spot, and orders Peter to sacrifice him in order for him to attain higher levels of power. Peter says that he would do so without hesitation, to avenge his son and mother. Mal'akh smirks and reveals that he is Zachary Solomon, and had killed the inmate beyond recognition to fake his death by bribing the warden (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy come to the same conclusion after they find an album with photos of Zach from Greece, showing his body changing from Zachary to Mal'akh). Emotionally shocked to his core, Peter prepares to stab Zach, but is unable to do so, and drops the knife right before Langdon tackles him, thinking that he had just saved Peter. Director Sato then arrives at the scene in a helicopter, which due to a bad pilot, crashes into the glass dome of TRotSRHotT and fatally wounds Zach. They then stop the video upload using an EMP blast, rendering all electronic devices useless. Katherine also arrives, and she has a very heart wrenching reunion with her brother (not really).

Peter then proceeds to reveal that he juked Zach, and that the circumpunct is not the Word, and that he had made backups of Katherine's research on his computer. Peter then (later) takes Langdon to the Washington Monument, where he tells Langdon that the Word - a simple Bible (the Word of God) - is the real secret, which was buried in the monument's cornerstone beneath it's staircase. Langdon then realizes that the words engraved at the bottom of the pyramid literally translate to *Praise God*. Peter continues, saying that the Bible is the real secret, a disguised piece of text that hid within it masked instructions for harnessing one's god-like abilities, similar to <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Which was saying that thoughts could affect the real world, and that giving a thought some emphasis could cause it to actually have mass in the real world.">Katherine's research</span>. The Masons believed that this knowledge was not something that should fall into the hands of evil, and as this interpretation was lost amid centuries of scientific uprise, the Masons have (metaphorically) buried it, saying that they will reveal everything when the time is right, ushering humanity into a new era of enlightenment.

### My thoughts

Okay, so this plot was also very long. But reading this book reawoke my love for thrillers, and led me to desperately search for the next book in the series, ie Origin, which is taking a complete U-turn from this plot as far as I can tell. I think that the Lost Symbol deserves a solid 4.5/5 rating, as although the plot and narration was beautiful, the book became a bit confusing at times, especially at the end when Peter was revealing everything. I highly recommend all of you to read this book, and all the other Dan Brown books that feature Robert Langdon.
