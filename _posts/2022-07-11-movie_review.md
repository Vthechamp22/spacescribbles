Okay so this movie may not look or sound or vibe appealing, but this movie is the best movie ever, trust me.  
I doubt any of you have watched it.  
Mostly because in this generation, watching old movies is regarded as uncool. You watch something old, you become a grandpa or grandma. This means that the stunning talent of bollywood actors like Kishore Kumar, Dev Anand are locked up, hidden deep down by our generation. Only a few strict parents are able to find this hidden treasure and open it, revealing its precious contents to their children, including bollywood classics such as the movie I'm going to be talking about: "Andaaz Apna Apna".

My introduction to classic bollywood went something like this:  
Dad: "What do you want to watch?"  
Me: "Let's watch something like Inceptio-"  
Dad: "Good choice. Let's watch it."  
[Proceeds to play Andaaz Apna Apna]  
Me: "But that's not wha-"  
Dad: "Are you trying to argue?"  
Me: "I- no."  
[Visible frown]

Looking back, today I'm thankful this happened to me.

Right, about the movie itself. It's old. Not very old, or black and white, (although I have watched black and white), but still old. Released in 1994, this wonderful classic piece stars two famous actors, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (doesn't sound that bad now, right?), along with two relatively newcomers at that time - Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor. And guess what? Paresh Rawal, the best actor from Hera Phiri, and Shakti Kapoor also played characters in this movie.


Moving on, the plot. I want to write a 5 paged essay on the plot, but to keep it short (warning, I now realise that I am physically incapable of keeping this short), let me summarise what happens. So the movie starts with the introduction of two daydreamers, Amar Manohar (Aamir Khan) and Prem Bhopali (Salman Khan). Both of them learn that millionaire Ram Gopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal)'s daughter, Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon), is coming to India in hopes of finding a husband, along with her secretary-cum-friend-cum-adviser-cum-attendant-cum-cook, Karishma (played by Karishma Kapoor). Both of them decide to woo her in order to get her father's empire.

They meet for the first time after Amar sells his father's business and Prem sells his father's house on a bus to Ooty (home of Raveena and Karishma). They later realise that they are both trying to marry the same girl, and get into a fight. Both of them manage to get into her house, Amar as a patient and Prem as his doctor. Amar pretends to have lost his memory after Raveena hits him when he was flirting with her. Prem pretends to have "smelled" the patient in this house and that he has come to cure him, but unbeknown to him, he falls in love with Karishma.

In a totally different world, it is revealed that Ram Gopal had an evil twin, Shyam Gopal, a.k.a "Teja", who was plotting to kill Raveena and get Ram Gopal's money. He had two sidekicks, Bhalla and Robert who were posed as Raveena's servants. After many failed attempts at killing Raveena, Teja gets to know that Ram Gopal is returning to India from London and has converted all his wealth into diamonds. Meanwhile, it is revealed to Amar and Prem that Raveena was actually Karishma, and Karishma was actually Raveena. So the person Prem loved was actually the daughter of the millionaire, and the person Amar loved was the daughter of their accountant. Because of the chaos that ensued, both of them decided that they will call the girls by the names that they were used to.

After Ram Gopal returns, he rejects both their marriage proposals. They plan a fake kidnapping. Their friends would kidnap Ram Gopal, and Amar and Prem would "heroically" save Ram Gopal, and they would become heroes in his eyes, and allow them to marry his daughters. Unfortunately, at the same time, Teja was planning the same thing, but so that he could impersonate Ram. Surprisingly, Bhalla and Robert were able to successfully kidnap Ram Gopal. Seeing the girls in distress, Amar and Prem collect a grand total of ₹8535.31 instead of the ransom of 50 lakhs. As it wasn't Teja's goal to earn money through the ransom like this, he accepts the ginormous ₹8535.31 and proceeds to impersonate Ram and return home.


A few days pass, and the girls notice something strange has happened to their father. He turned the house upside down (in an attempt to find the diamonds) and was behaving strangely. Amar and Prem follow their suspicion and return to Teja's hideout. Over there, they see both Ram and Shyam together, and realise that Ram had a lookalike. They formulate a plan to rescue Ram, this time for real, and return to the hideout. But they didnt know that Ram had actually managed to escape the jail and put Teja in instead. And... Amar Prem manage to put Ram back in jail and get Teja out.

Fortunately, they were able to convince the dimwitted Robert and Bhalla to let them out, where they catch an escaping Teja. Going on in parallel in the movie, the nephew of Mogambo, Crime Master Gogo, gets to know that Ram Gopal is in India and has diamonds worth a fortune. Gogo then proceeds to kidnap Ram Gopal and the girls, and Teja and Bhalla and Robert. Amar and Prem's friend, Anand, sees all this and reports this to them. At Gogo's hideout, there is a hilarious standoff between Amar, Prem, Raveena, Karishma, Teja, Gogo, Robert, Bhalla, Gogo's men, Ram Gopal, and more people that I can't seem to remember. Eventually, there is a long chain of "pass the diamonds because there is a gun pointed at your head" where finally, the police arrive and return the diamonds to Ram, who agrees to marry off Amar and Prem to Raveena (Karishma?) and Karishma (Raveena?) respectively. 


If you didn't understand a thing, I don't blame you. Reading an elaborate plot is much harder than experiencing it by watching the movie. Which is why you should watch the movie. Fortunately for you, this masterpiece isn't afraid of being watched. I personally, for example, have watched this 5 times already, and counting. I doubt you can beat my record. (Yes I'm baiting you into watching this movie, which you really should.)
